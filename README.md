# SCADAAnalysis

There is a lot that can be done with SCADA systems / IoT and Data Science. This is a small project, but overall we can go from predicting signal behavior, to find out anomalies within the automation monitoring system to be able to predict failures before they take place. To check the automation sytem to be able to detect when is a good time to perform a maintence job in a factory. We can use data science to predict production requirements. Etc we are data scientist consultants and we are here to point out you as a client into the right direction.
